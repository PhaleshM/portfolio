## Gesture Recognition
Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on a leapGestRecog dataset (20,000 images of hand gestures) from the Kaggle Hand Gesture Recognition Database, which includes nine different types of gestures. Additionally, we developed a Wrist-worn Neural Artificial Intelligence (WNAI) system using the Mediapipe Hand Landmark model as a backup to recognize hand gestures.
