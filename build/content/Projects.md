## Medicinal Plant Identification And Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot
Designed and implemented a robust backend system for an AI chatbot, integrating RAG processing and a CNN model (InceptionV3) for medicinal plant identification. Developed a seamless API service for predicting plant names and a responsive RAG Chatbot, showcasing adaptability and resourcefulness in overcoming project constraints. Utilized technologies including Django Rest Framework, Hugging Face, Tensorflow, LangChain, and OpenAI to create production-level RAG and AI systems.

## Gesture Recognition
Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on a leapGestRecog dataset (20,000 images of hand gestures) from the Kaggle Hand Gesture Recognition Database, which includes nine different types of gestures. Additionally, we developed a Wrist-worn Neural Artificial Intelligence (WNAI) system using the Mediapipe Hand Landmark model as a backup to recognize hand gestures.
